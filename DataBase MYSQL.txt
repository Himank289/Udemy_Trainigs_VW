Normalisation: splitting columns into multiple tables
1NF- 1. Every column should have contain 1 value 
2.Table must have a primary key
3. no duplicate rows

2NF - 1NF and every column which is not a primary key should dependent on whole of primary key

3NF - 2NF any non primary key column is dependent only on the whole of the primary key
